               <strong> A RATIO is a comparison of two quantities by division. 
                -The ratio of a to b can be written in two ways: 
                a. as a:b (odds notation), where the symbol “:” is read as “is to”;

                        x/y always the same holds true with the ratio y/x. (Licuanan, P., 2016)</strong></p>
                        <p class="features-tittle"></p>
                        <p class="features-text"><strong>Example: </strong>
                            State whether X and Y are directly proportional or not in the following table:

                            Since each of the ratios of the corresponding values of X and Y is a constant equal to 1/3, X and Y are directly proportional.

                            We know that if X and Y vary inversely, then the product (X, Y) remains the same for all the values of X and Y. Here, 8 X 32 = 256, 16 X 16 = 256, 32 X 8 = 256, 4 X 64 = 256 and 256 X 1 = 256. Clearly, the products of all the values of X and Y are the same, that is, 256. 
                            Therefore, X and Y vary inversely.</p>
